## Why

Firefox's lack of support for PWAs made me look for an alternative to quickly access JungleReader without relying on a simple bookmark.

## JungleReader

JungleReader is a free + open-source feed reader made by Matt Riley.

- Repo: https://github.com/mgriley/BigOlJungle

The JungleReader icon was taken from the original site and belongs to its creator. I take no credit for anything related to JungleReader other than this sidebar extension. Thank you, mgriley, for such an amazing project.
